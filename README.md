# SRP2Vec:


This page is about the source code and relevant data of "Word sense disambiguation based on word similarity calculation using word vector representation from a knowledge-based graph." 

Since the upload file is very large, the source code of our knowledge-based WSD and pretrained word vector representations the are available in "https://zenodo.org/record/4437871#.YB0oa-gzaUk".
